1. Initialize the random number generator (e.g., srand(time(NULL)) to seed the generator).

2. Generate a random number using rand().

3. Use the modulo operator (%) to obtain a value between 0 and 3.

4. Optionally, assign the result to a variable for later use.

Pseudocode:

   // Initialize the random number generator
   srand(current_time);

   // Generate a random number between 0 and 3 (inclusive)
   random_number = rand() % 4;

   // Use the random number as needed



1. Check if there is a character in the receive queue.

2. If there is a character:
    - Perform the desired actions (e.g., set a flag, execute a function, etc.).
    - Do not dequeue the character.

3. If there is no character:
    - Continue with the main program or other tasks.




Function ComputeScore(roundNumber, timeTaken):
    Constants:
        MAX_ROUND_TIME = 11  ; Maximum time allowed for any round

    Variables:
        baseScore       ; Base score for the round
        timePenalty     ; Time penalty for rounds that take longer

    Procedure:
        IF timeTaken <= MAX_ROUND_TIME - roundNumber:
            ; Calculate base score based on round number
            baseScore = roundNumber * 10

            ; Calculate time penalty
            timePenalty = (MAX_ROUND_TIME - timeTaken) * 5

            ; Final score for the round
            roundScore = baseScore + timePenalty
        ELSE:
            ; If time is up, no time penalty
            roundScore = roundNumber * 10

        RETURN roundScore
